I am a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science at [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/), working with Prof. [Thien Huu Nguyen](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/) in the [UONLP lab](http://nlp.uoregon.edu/) in Multilingual Natural Language Processing with the focus on Information Extraction. Before starting my Ph.D., I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from [Hanoi University of Science and Technology](https://en.hust.edu.vn/home) and was a member of the [DS lab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/) and Dr. [Linh Ngo Van](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/).

Education
------
  * **University of Oregon**
    * Ph.D. in Computer and Information Science, 2019 - .
    * Advisor: Prof. [Thien Huu Nguyen](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/).
  * **Hanoi University of Science and Technology**
    * B.S. in Computer Science, 2014 - 2019.
    * Advisor: Dr. [Linh Ngo Van](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/).


Software
------
   * **FourIE**: a neural information extraction system that annotates text for entity mentions (names, pronouns, and nominals of people, organizations, locations, etc), relations (between two entity mentions), event triggers and argument roles using the information schema defined in the ACE 2005 dataset. FourIE leverages deep learning and graph convolutional networks to jointly perform four tasks in information extraction, i.e., entity mention detection, relation extraction, event detection and argument role prediction in an end-to-end fashion. [Demo](http://nlp.uoregon.edu/fourie).
   * **Trankit**: a light-weight transformer-based toolkit for multilingual NLP that can process raw text and support fundamental NLP tasks for 56 languages. Trankit is based on recent advances on multilingual pre-trained language models, providing state-of-the-art performance for Sentence Segmentation, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Morphological Feature Tagging, Dependency Parsing, and Named Entity Recognition over 90 Universal Dependencies treebanks. Trankit is written in Python and can be installed via pip. [Github](https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/trankit), [Demo](http://nlp.uoregon.edu/trankit), [Documentation](https://trankit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


Projects
------
   * [**IARPA Better Extraction from Text Towards Enhanced Retrieval (BETTER)**](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/better)
     * Research Assistant, January 2020 - .
     * I am a Research Assistant for the project where I've been building different cross-lingual information extraction systems (with English as the source language) for extracting events in the form of who-did-what-to-whom-when-where, at different granularity levels of information, across various target languages.
