I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/). I have been working with Prof. [Thien Huu Nguyen](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/) in the [UONLP lab](http://nlp.uoregon.edu/) in Multilingual Information Extraction, which aims to develop systems for extracting structured information from unstructured text in different languages. Recent notable projects, where I am the lead author, are [Trankit](https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/trankit) (a state-of-the-art multilingual NLP toolkit for 56 languages), [FourIE](http://nlp.uoregon.edu/fourie) (a state-of-the-art multilingual joint IE system for English, Chinese, and Spanish), and [FAMIE](https://github.com/nlp-uoregon/famie) (a fast active learning framework for multilingual IE). I am also a research assistant for the [IARPAâ€™s BETTER project](https://www.iarpa.gov/index.php/research-programs/better), where I have been building systems to extract events and arguments of different granularities (i.e., Abstract, Basic, and Granular levels) from English, Arabic, Farsi, Chinese, Russian, and Korean text.

Software
------
I am the lead author of the following software:
   * **FourIE**: a neural information extraction system that annotates text for entity mentions (names, pronouns, and nominals of people, organizations, locations, etc), relations (between two entity mentions), event triggers and argument roles using the information schema defined in the ACE 2005 dataset. FourIE leverages deep learning and graph convolutional networks to jointly perform four tasks in information extraction, i.e., entity mention detection, relation extraction, event detection and argument role prediction in an end-to-end fashion. FourIE can work for 3 languages (English, Chinese, and Spanish). [Demo for English](http://nlp.uoregon.edu/fourie).
   * **Trankit**: a light-weight transformer-based toolkit for multilingual NLP that can process raw text and support fundamental NLP tasks for 56 languages. Trankit is based on recent advances on multilingual pre-trained language models, providing state-of-the-art performance for Sentence Segmentation, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Morphological Feature Tagging, Dependency Parsing, and Named Entity Recognition over 90 Universal Dependencies treebanks. Trankit is written in Python and can be installed via pip.
